abstract = "Functionally  rare  species  can  support  unique  functions  for  ecosystems.   Moreover,  identifying the distribution and drivers of functional rarity across space and time is of tremendous importance for conservation ecology.  However, functional rarity remains an overlooked facet of functional diversity.\nWe used a worldwide coral reef fish database comprising 2073 species occurrences in 259 locations with complete information for 6 traits related to major ecological functions as well as a phylogenetic tree of all those species.  Functional Rarity is defined as the originality of a species given its neighbor in a community.  For each species we computed functional rarity, evolutionary distinctiveness and geographic range indices.\nWe found that evolutionary distinctiveness of a species does not correlate with functional rarity. Species restrictedness in space and functional distinctiveness let us classify species in different categories:  functionally rare or common & geographically restricted or widespread at a global scale. Our  results  show  that  the  originality  of  a  species  by  its  traits  cannot  be  estimated  from  its position  in  a  phylogenetic  tree.   Our  work  also  underlines  the  lack  of  IUCN  assessments  for functionally rare species.  It could be used to prioritize species for which an assessment should be made."
