Functional rarity also called functional originality or trait originality is the characteristic of species (or any other biological unit) that makes it different relative to a well defined set.

Why are original species interesting? Original species can provide: irreplaceable trait, meaning that original species disappear no other species are going to present the same trait values in the set; original specis may also represent original ecological strategies, if the trait space represents the niche space well then original species show original strategies; finally original species can help uncover specific community assembly processes, or combination of processes because they are not well predicted nor accounted for by current theories.

Through the [Functional Rarity in Ecology and Evolution](http://www.cesab.org/index.php/en/projets-en-cours/projets-2015) synthesis group funded by the CESAB, we discuss and test new ideas regarding functional rarity.
