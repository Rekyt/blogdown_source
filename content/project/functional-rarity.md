Functional rarity is a concept developed by Violle et al. (2017). One aim of my PhD is to develop and test this concept.
Through the [Functional Rarity in Ecology and Evolution](http://www.cesab.org/index.php/en/projets-en-cours/projets-2015) synthesis group funded by the CESAB, we discuss and test new ideas regarding functional rarity.
