I strongly think that biodiversity science needs robust standardized tools to make it a better science. This passes through formalizing the workflows and developping useful abstracted tools that can be reused across contexts.

One particular concern I have is that tool developers generally receive less credit than users while they support essential function for science.

Robust tools are crucial to develop a truly reproducible science.

This collective endeavor can only take place in a open-source software environment as scientific tools are part of the common goods.
