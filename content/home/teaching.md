UM: University of Montpellier; UL: University of Leipzig

I am a certified Instructor for [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), focusing on **R programming** (especially for ecology) and **Data Visualization**.

I also founded the R User Group at the Center for Functional and Evolutionary Ecology in Montpellier. There, I organized regular 1h meet-ups on various R topics (plotting with `ggplot2`, mapping with `sf`, project organization with RStudio, workflow organization with `drake`, parallelization with `future`).
