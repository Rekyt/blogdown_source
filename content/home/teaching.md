I am a certified Instructor for [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), focusing on **R programming** (especially for ecology) and **Data Visualization**.

I also taught the following courses at University:

- Practicals in Descriptive Statistics for Ecology (3 * 15 hours, sophomore, University of Montpellier)

I also funded the R User Group of our lab. I organize regular meetups for the group.
